# Gym Tracking App Proposal

## Project Overview

The Gym Tracking App is designed to help users efficiently track their fitness routines and progress. The app will allow users to log workouts, monitor performance, and analyze improvements over time. This tool aims to enhance the gym experience by providing insights into personal progress and enabling goal-oriented training.

## Features

1. **Workout Tracking**:
   - Log exercises, sets, reps, and weights for each session.
   - Include a database of common exercises with the ability to add custom ones.

2. **Progress Monitoring**:
   - Visualize progress over time using graphs and charts.
   - Compare performance across weeks, months, and specific exercises.

3. **Goal Setting**:
   - Allow users to set fitness goals (e.g., increase squat weight by 20kg in 3 months).
   - Provide notifications and progress updates toward these goals.

4. **Activity Insights**:
   - Track workout frequency and duration.
   - Highlight best performances and personal records.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Simple, intuitive design optimized for mobile and desktop use.

## Technical Requirements

- **Frontend**: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on responsive design.
- **Backend**: Powered by Python for data processing and storage.
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight and efficient data storage.
- **Integration**: API support for syncing data with wearables like fitness trackers.

## Progress to Date

- Log and save workouts.
- View history and personal records.

## Future enhancements
- I want to implement charts and graphs to visualise progress.
- AI-generated workout recommendations based on user performance.
